 SVN commit message says it's from MegaGlest; MegaGlest SVN says it's from soundbible.
 Deveee probably cropped it from one of the following recordings, though I honestly can't tell the difference.

 Assembled by samuncle from public-domain sounds. The ding-dong sound effect is from here:
 http://freesound.org/people/2887679652/sounds/171755/
 And the voice acting is from this forum thread:

 I could not find the wormux author's name... without looking through all the author's website for a mention of it. :(

 From http://pdsounds.org/effects/comic-spring-up-or-magic-trick/
 I found this by looking through the backup of the database here:
 pdsounds.tuxfamily.org. Currently pdsounds is still not 100% working but it sort-of works.
 Although I could not actually listen to the sound at the link above, I confirmed it was the
 same by examining the HTML, which referenced the same sound file (comic_doop.mp3) as I found
 in the backup of the database, which I was able to confirm is the same as that in STK.

 Considered public domain due to:
 (1) Threshold of originality
 (2) Lack of explicit copyright mention at time of publication when explicit notice was required.
 Dubious; but supposedly no one's ever tried to sue anyone because of it.
