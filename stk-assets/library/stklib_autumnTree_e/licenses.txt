Comment:
 I don't actually know whether Sven is the author of this model. For one thing, it
 contains Blender materials (a sign that it was imported from e.g. BlendSwap) and
 it didn't originally follow the naming conventions of the Black Forest track I pulled
 it from. "Jammyjamjamman" might deserve credit here.
